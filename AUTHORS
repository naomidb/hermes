# Hermes Authors
Hermes was created by the University of Florida and their
CTS-IT Team to help ingest data from Pubmed and format it
to be used in the VIVO system.

Here is an invetiably incomplete list of our beloved contributors.
These are all the people who have contributed code, knowledge, patience,
bug requests, among other things, to this project.
